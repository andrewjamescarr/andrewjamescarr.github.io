						<h3>🙋 About Me</h3>
						<h4>Conversation starters</h4>
						<p>Not great at small talk?  Get started with one of these conversation starters.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Why I took up running.</li>
							<li>The time I handcuffed myself to a shopping trolley.</li>
							<li>The Back to the Future Trilogy.</li>
							<li>Why I became qualified as a touch-typist at age 16 (RSA I/II/III, Pitman Advanced, C&G).</li>
							<li>One space or two after a full stop; discuss.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>My humour</h4>
						<p>Dark.  Occasionally smutty.  Shaped by Bottom, Red Dwarf, Blackadder, and a childhood of British comedy where wit required reading between the lines.</p>
						<p><em>My eldest daughter has decided it's a feature, not a bug.  I'm inclined to agree.</em></p>

					<h3>💬 Communication</h3>
					
					<h4>How to reach me (in order of preference)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Email:</strong> For anything that needs detail, retrieval, or a record.</li>
						<li><strong>Teams:</strong> For time-sensitive things that need same-day response.</li>
						<li><strong>WhatsApp/Signal:</strong> For truly urgent matters that need immediate attention.</li>
						<li><strong>Teams call:</strong> Only if it's genuinely urgent; I'll pick up.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>My communication style</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Direct and explicit:</strong> Never intended to offend, but clarity wins over softness.</li>
						<li><strong>I read everything:</strong> I reply only when needed.  Silence usually means I agree.</li>
						<li><strong>Writing beats in-person:</strong> I'm clearer in writing.  In conversation, you'll hear my thinking process out loud.</li>
						<li><strong>Over-communication wins:</strong> Use bullets, use @mentions, be specific.<br />Ambiguity is worse than too much detail.</li>
						<li><strong>Clear asks, not pings:</strong> "Hello" without context is noise.  Specific asks are music.  See <a href="https://nohello.net/en">nohello.net</a> for why.</li>
						<li><strong>Names matter:</strong> Getting your name right is important.  If I get it wrong, I genuinely want to know.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Email specifics</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>CC:</strong> Means "for your information".  I check it less frequently than TO lines.</li>
						<li><strong>@mentions:</strong> Flag action required.  I'll see these and prioritise response.</li>
						<li><strong>Structure:</strong> Lead with the ask/action/deadline, then reasoning, then supporting facts.<br />See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deliver-bottom-line-up-front-andrew-james-carr/">Bottom line up front</a> for why.</li>
						<li><strong>Everything is kept:</strong> I read and archive everything.  Useful for reference and follow-up.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="logistics">
					<h3>🧭 Logistics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Bristol office:</strong> Monday and Wednesday (7am to 4pm).  I have a 2 hour commute!</li>
						<li><strong>Remote or customer sites:</strong> Other days with core hours roughly 10am to 4pm, with flexibility for life.</li>
						<li><strong>Non-negotiable:</strong> Evenings and weekends are family time.</li>
						<li><strong>Dispersed teams:</strong> I adapt for global collaboration; I take time back later.</li>
						<li><strong>Your boundaries matter:</strong> Please share yours so we can respect them together.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

			<section id="availability">
				<h3>📅 Availability</h3>
				
				<h4>Calendar management</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>What's on my calendar is accurate:</strong> If it's blocked, I'm not available.</li>
					<li><strong>Focus blocks:</strong> Purple blocks = deep work, do not disturb.</li>
					<li><strong>Flexible time:</strong> White space = available for meetings if you need me.</li>
					<li><strong>Book directly:</strong> You don't need to ask permission; just send the invite.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Response time expectations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Email:</strong> 24-48 hours for non-urgent matters</li>
					<li><strong>Teams:</strong> Same-day during working hours</li>
					<li><strong>Urgent channels:</strong> Within 1 hour if truly urgent</li>
					<li><strong>Outside hours:</strong> I won't respond until next working day</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Best times to book me</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Mondays/Wednesdays:</strong> 10am-3pm (in Bristol office, easier for in-person)</li>
					<li><strong>Other days:</strong> 11am-3pm (remote, better for focused conversations)</li>
					<li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Before 9am, after 4pm, or Friday afternoons</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Regular time off</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>School holidays:</strong> I may have reduced availability for childcare</li>
					<li><strong>Notice:</strong> I'll flag capacity changes at least 2 weeks ahead</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
		<section id="feedback">
			<h3>💬 How to Give Me Feedback</h3>
			
			<h4>What I need from you</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Be direct:</strong> Open and honest wins.  I can handle it.</li>
				<li><strong>Tell me how to improve:</strong> Don't just tell me what I'm doing wrong.  Tell me what good looks like and how I can get there.</li>
				<li><strong>Make it clear you're giving feedback:</strong> Say "I want to give you some feedback" so I know to listen differently.</li>
				<li><strong>In the moment is best:</strong> Feedback minutes or hours after something happens is useful.  Days or weeks later loses context and impact.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>How you'll know I've heard it</h4>
			<p>I'll play back what I've heard to you.  This helps me check I understood correctly and shows I'm taking it seriously.</p>

			<h4>Don't be scared</h4>
			<p>If you're worried about giving me verbal feedback - don't be.  Honestly.  I'd rather hear it directly from you than wonder what you're thinking or have it come up later in a review.  Direct feedback helps me improve faster and shows you care about working well together.</p>

<section id="no-protocols-basic">
			<h3>🚫 The "No" Protocols</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>How to ask:</strong> Written requests with context and clear ask.  Not drop-in interruptions.</li>
				<li><strong>I say no to:</strong> End-of-day asks, meetings without agendas, surprise decisions, info dumps.</li>
				<li><strong>Truly urgent means:</strong> Life/death or imminent harm.  Everything else can wait for a response.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>See <a href="#no-protocols-advanced">Advanced: No Protocols</a> for full context and why I'm working on this.</em></p>
		</section>

		<section id="work-intake">
			<h3>📥 Work Intake Process</h3>
			<p>The "No Protocols" explain what I won't do.  This explains how to give me work in a way that works for both of us.  I manage capacity carefully, so clear intake helps me prioritize fairly.</p>

			<h4>How to submit work</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Use the Teams INGEST bot:</strong> Type <code>/ingest</code> in a Teams chat or channel (still being built, but it'll guide you through the questions below).</li>
				<li><strong>Or submit directly:</strong> Email, Teams message, meeting notes, or Planner comment—anywhere works.  I'll ingest it.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>What I need to know</h4>
			<p>Include as much as possible:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Context:</strong> Why does this exist?  What problem are we solving?</li>
				<li><strong>The ask:</strong> What specifically do you need from me?  (Decide?  Review?  Build?  Unblock?)</li>
				<li><strong>Deadline:</strong> When do you need it?  "No rush" is useful too.</li>
				<li><strong>Who's asking:</strong> You, your manager, leadership team?  (Helps me prioritize.)</li>
				<li><strong>Impact/Urgency:</strong> What happens if we don't do this?  Business impact?  Blocker for others?</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>My capacity model</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>I hold max 3 active work items.</strong> Everything else sits in Triage until something completes.</li>
				<li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Urgent/Impact first, then seniority level (requests from my VP+ get higher priority), then order received.</li>
				<li><strong>Fair expectations:</strong> Work from senior leadership gets higher priority, but I'll be transparent about impact with you.  ("This moves your deadline back because X is critical now.")</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Track your work in Planner</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Check the backlog:</strong> Everything I've ingested lives on my Planner board.  It's your source of truth.</li>
				<li><strong>Status updates:</strong> Look for comments on your item.  I update via comment, not messages.</li>
				<li><strong>Triage means "not yet assessed":</strong> Your request is logged but not prioritized yet.  Don't worry, I see it.</li>
				<li><strong>In Progress means I'm working on it.</strong> Blocked means I'm waiting on something.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="working-preferences">
			<h3>⚙️ Working Preferences</h3>
			
			<h4>My tools of choice</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>LogSeq and Obsidian:</strong> My go-to tools for notes, knowledge management, and thinking through problems.</li>
				<li><strong>Bullet journaling:</strong> When I can't use digital tools, I revert to pen and paper.  Still effective.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>I work in the open</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Available from day one:</strong> If I'm writing a whitepaper or document, it's accessible as soon as I write the first line.  No need to wait for "done".</li>
				<li><strong>No permissions needed:</strong> I'll communicate where my open working directory is.  Jump in, read along, comment, collaborate.</li>
				<li><strong>Work in progress is valuable:</strong> You'll see my thinking evolve.  Early feedback is welcome and saves rework later.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Documentation is my happy place</h4>
			<p>I love writing documentation.  Yes, I'm a nerd.  Clear docs reduce confusion, save time, and help teams scale.  If something needs documenting, I'm probably already excited about it.</p>

		<h3>🧠 How I Like to Work</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Meetings as a last resort:</strong> I prefer async communication and written updates.  If we need a meeting, there should be clear preparation, a pre-read, and a specific agenda.  No surprises.</li>
			<li><strong>I hate surprises:</strong> Flag blockers, delays, scope changes, or problems early so I can adjust and respond thoughtfully.  Transparency before panic.</li>
			<li><strong>I need preparation time:</strong> I minimize notifications during deep work (email off, Teams on DND).  During focus blocks, I'm truly focused.  Come back when the time is right.</li>
			<li><strong>Capture as you go:</strong> Meeting notes and actions should be written collaboratively in real time.  Clarity in the moment saves rework later.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>How I structure 1:1s</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Shared working doc:</strong> We keep running notes in Teams, Confluence, or SharePoint.  Agenda is yours.  Raise concerns, development topics, blockers, anything that matters.</li>
			<li><strong>Pastoral, not status:</strong> 1:1s are for relationship-building and development, not project status (that's async).  If you need something, I'm here for it.</li>
			<li><strong>Your agenda:</strong> You own what we discuss.  I'm here to listen, coach, unblock, and support your growth.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

		<section id="decision-frameworks">
			<h3>🧩 Decision Frameworks</h3>
			<p>I use a few core principles to make calls clearly.  Here's how I think about decisions:</p>
			
			<h4>The four signals I need before deciding</h4>
			<p>If I'm missing any of these, I'm gambling, not deciding.  I need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root cause signal:</strong> Is this a symptom or the disease? Example: "Sales are down" is a symptom; "the checkout button is broken" is the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Reversibility signal:</strong> How hard is it to undo this decision?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Type 1 (one-way door):</strong> Very difficult to reverse.  Slow down.  Seek 90% confidence and multiple expert opinions.</li>
						<li><strong>Type 2 (two-way door):</strong> Can be undone easily.  Move fast.  Seek 60-70% confidence.  Progress beats perfection.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li><strong>Counter-evidence signal:</strong> What's the strongest argument against this choice? If I can't find one, I probably have confirmation bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity cost signal:</strong> If I spend time and resources on Option A, what am I explicitly choosing NOT to do?</li>
            </ul>

			<h4>The WRAP process</h4>
			<p>I use this to prevent short-term emotion from affecting outcomes:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Widen my options:</strong> I never choose between "yes or no".  I force myself to find at least three viable alternatives.</li>
			  <li><strong>Reality test:</strong> I find someone who disagrees with me and understand why.  This challenges my thinking.</li>
			  <li><strong>Attain distance:</strong> What would I tell a friend to do in this situation? This removes my immediate fear or ego.</li>
			  <li><strong>Prepare to be wrong:</strong> Set a tripwire—"If X hasn't happened by Y, we stop and reassess."</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Resources I rely on</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393652370">The Decision Book</a> by Mikael Krogerus</li>
				<li><a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Mental Models</a> by Farnam Street</li>

		<section id="measurement-of-success">
			<h3>📊 Measurement of Success</h3>
			<p>I don't care where you do your work. It's about outputs and impact.  Here's how I measure whether work is actually successful:</p>

			<h4>What "done" actually means</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Feature shipped to users:</strong> Code merged is nice; users benefiting is better.  It needs to be working and production-ready.</li>
				<li><strong>Code quality checked:</strong> If you're rushing code through the pipeline ignoring quality issues flagged in review, it's not "done".  Get it right the first time.</li>
				<li><strong>Decision made and documented:</strong> We might find it's wrong later.  That's fine.  But if you made it using available information and can explain why, that's success.  Document your reasoning so we learn from it.</li>
				<li><strong>Deliverables completed:</strong> Even if not perfect.  Progress over perfection.  Completed, not abandoned.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>How I measure impact</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Move your objectives forward:</strong> And help move others' forward too.  Don't be selfish.  Think about company impact.</li>
				<li><strong>Use data to prove it:</strong> Saved cloud costs?  Made something more efficient?  Faster resolution on tickets?  Spread knowledge?  Show me the metrics.</li>
				<li><strong>Customer validation matters:</strong> Faster ticket resolution is great, unless the customer doesn't think the ticket is closed.  They're the judge.  Check that they're happy it's closed; then it's closed.</li>
				<li><strong>Open documentation:</strong> Don't hoard knowledge.  Write it down so others can benefit and learn from what you did.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Quality philosophy: The rework test</h4>
		<p><strong>Quality threshold: "Will this require someone else to fix it or rework it?"</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>YES:</strong> Slow down and get it right first.  The further code moves up the pipeline, the more expensive rework becomes.</li>
			<li><strong>NO:</strong> Ship it.  Iterate if you need to.  Done is better than perfect.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Quality principles</h5>
		<ul>
				<li><strong>No 2am wake-ups:</strong> If you broke something downstream and someone has to run a manual process at 2am, that's not done.  That's leaving a mess.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>The metrics that actually matter</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Deployment frequency of working features:</strong> How often are you shipping things users can use?</li>
				<li><strong>Test coverage and quality:</strong> Does this need testing?  Are the pipelines passing?</li>
				<li><strong>Decisions made vs delayed, and accepted:</strong> Did you make the call?  Does it stick?</li>
				<li><strong>People unblocked:</strong> How many colleagues can now move forward because of your work?</li>
				<li><strong>Time spent mentoring:</strong> Are you growing others?</li>
				<li><strong>Documentation written:</strong> Did you leave good records?</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>What's NOT success</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Constant rework:</strong> Delivering something, then having to fix it repeatedly wastes everyone's time.</li>
				<li><strong>Breaking things downstream:</strong> Your feature works, but it cascades failures to other teams.  That's a problem.</li>
				<li><strong>Shipping without user validation:</strong> You built it.  Does anyone actually use it?  Does it solve their problem?</li>
				<li><strong>GitHub commit history as a proxy for work:</strong> Lots of commits ≠ good work.  Deployment frequency of working features is better.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>🎓 How I Learn Best</h3>
		<p><strong>I learn by doing, not by watching.</strong> Give me solid pre-read time first so I can immerse myself and prepare, then let me get hands-on with feedback as I go.  I'll ask questions to validate my understanding.</p>

		<h4>Pre-read essentials</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>High-level overviews and diagrams:</strong> Diagrams are more useful than people think.</li>
			<li><strong>Skip the code:</strong> I don't read much code; focus on the architecture and the why, not the implementation details.</li>
			<li><strong>Give me time:</strong> Let me immerse myself in the material before we start.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>The hands-on part</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>I'll watch what you're doing:</strong> Not necessarily have it explained step-by-step.</li>
			<li><strong>I'll ask questions:</strong> To validate my understanding as I go.</li>
			<li><strong>Feedback in the moment:</strong> Helps me learn faster.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>The clarity test</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>If I can't understand it, it's over-complicated:</strong> That's a signal to simplify.</li>
			<li><strong>When something's unclear:</strong> Simplify the language, add examples, or break it into smaller pieces.</li>
			<li><strong>If I struggle, others will too.</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>What doesn't work</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Click-click-click e-learning modules:</strong> I switch off.  Dull, monotonous training loses me.</li>
			<li><strong>Passive watching:</strong> Without the chance to engage, I'm not learning.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>What I need from you</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Show me passion and energy.</strong> I feed off it.  Engagement matters more than perfection.</li>
			<li><strong>Be excited about what you're teaching.</strong> That energy is contagious.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="collaboration">
		<h3>👥 Collaboration</h3>

		<h4>Whiteboarding is my thinking tool</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>In-person:</strong> Shared drawing and whiteboards.</li>
			<li><strong>Online:</strong> Shared whiteboard tools or MS Paint if needed; tablets are great for quick sketches.</li>
			<li><strong>A picture paints a thousand words:</strong> I use drawing for all problem types: architecture decisions, process flows, problem decomposition.</li>
			<li><strong>Everyone draws simultaneously:</strong> This is collaborative thinking, not passive watching.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Free-form and expansive:</strong> Build on ideas; don't sit in your own bubble waiting to create something new.</li>
			<li><strong>Building on an idea is as valuable as creating one.</strong> I'll say "that's interesting, what if we..." as much as I'll propose something from scratch.</li>
			<li><strong>After we brainstorm:</strong> We share the sketches to broaden knowledge and document thinking.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Documentation & write-ups</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Work in the open:</strong> Share sketches and thinking as we go.</li>
			<li><strong>Sometimes I own the write-up:</strong> The act of writing helps me figure things out.  I tend to want it to be perfect, so I may iterate.</li>
			<li><strong>The goal is shared knowledge:</strong> Not gatekeeping.  Get it documented so others can learn and build on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>🚫 The "No" Protocols (Full Context)</h3>
			<p>I struggle with saying no.  I want to help, and I worry that setting boundaries means letting people down.  But unfiltered access to my time means I can't do deep work, and "yes" without process means commitments I can't keep.  Here's how I'm trying to protect focus without being a blocker:</p>

			<h4>How to ask for my time (the pipeline)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Written requests win:</strong> Email or Teams message with context, the ask, and why it matters.  This lets me assess impact, urgency, and fit with current work.</li>
				<li><strong>Not drop-in asks:</strong> "Can you check this?" or "Can you read this?" interrupts focus and ignores my existing pipeline.  Use the written request process instead.</li>
				<li><strong>Lead time matters:</strong> Same-day asks are gambling on my availability.  I need time to review, think, and prepare; especially for decisions.</li>
				<li><strong>My counter-offer:</strong> "Yes, but later" or "Yes, but let me read it first".  I'm happy to help, just not instantly.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>When I automatically say no</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>End-of-day asks:</strong> My brain is checked out.  If you catch me at 3:45pm, I'm not ready for new information.  Come back tomorrow.</li>
				<li><strong>Surprise AOB items:</strong> Last-minute "any other business" that requires decisions or commitment.  If it's not on the agenda, it waits.</li>
				<li><strong>Meetings without agendas:</strong> No prep, no clarity, no attendance.  See <a href="#how-i-work">How I Like to Work</a> for why.</li>
				<li><strong>Information dumps followed by "decide now":</strong> I can't process a wall of verbal information and make good calls.  Write it down, then I'll engage.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>What counts as truly urgent</h4>
			<p>If you need me <em>right now</em>, it should be one of these:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Life or death:</strong> Literal safety risk to people.</li>
				<li><strong>Imminent harm:</strong> We're about to destroy something critical (data, systems, relationships, reputation).</li>

			<h4>What I'm working on (honestly)</h4>
			<p>I'm trying to stop trading my time now for theoretical future reciprocity.  Saying yes doesn't bank goodwill, it just means I'm overcommitted and underdelivering.  I need better boundaries, but I'm not there yet.  If you see me slipping, call it out.</p>

						<p>Welcome to the Production Environment.  Whilst every effort has been made to ship a stable version of myself, please be advised that this build contains several legacy features and unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
						<p>Below you'll find a comprehensive list of Known Defects.  Quirky architectural choices and 'working-as-intended' bugs that haven't quite made it to the next sprint.  I decided to treat these as documented features rather than system failures, so please review the changelog below before submitting a formal bug report.</p>
						<table>
							<thead>
								<tr><th>Defect</th><th>Workaround</th></tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr><td><strong>Migraine</strong><br />Stress, tiredness, poor eating/drinking can trigger; early signs: difficulty concentrating, possible emesis.</td><td>Sleep in a dark room; coffee, painkillers, sumatriptan.</td></tr>
								<tr><td><strong>Context assumption</strong><br />I may assume shared context and skip details.</td><td>Ask me to add context; I will happily expand.</td></tr>
								<tr><td><strong>Misophonia</strong><br/>Noises like loud eating/tea slurping can trigger.</td><td>If I eat too the effect lessens; I may step away briefly.</td></tr>
