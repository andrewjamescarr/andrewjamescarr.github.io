						<h4>My humour</h4>
						<p>Dark. Occasionally smutty. Shaped by Bottom, Red Dwarf, Blackadder, and a childhood of British comedy where wit required reading between the lines.</p>
						<p><em>My 11-year-old has decided it's a feature, not a bug. I'm inclined to agree.</em></p>

						<h4>Favourite quote</h4>
	                    <blockquote class="featured-quote">

					<h3>💬 Communication</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Preferred urgency ladder: Email → Teams → WhatsApp → Teams phone call.</li>
						<li>Email for detail and retrieval; real-time only when truly needed.</li>
						<li>If a thread needs &gt;2 - 3 back-and-forths, suggest voice/video.</li>
						<li>Direct style; never intended to offend - explicit and unambiguous is the goal.</li>
						<li>Clear, bullet-heavy writing appreciated; over-communication beats ambiguity.</li>
						<li>Clear asks beat "Hello" pings; see <a href="https://nohello.net/en">https://nohello.net/en</a>.</li>
						<li>I'm clearer in writing than in person; in person you may hear my thinking process aloud.</li>
						<li><strong>Names are our identity:</strong> Getting your name right matters, and I will ask if I'm unsure.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Email specifics</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>I read everything; I reply only when needed.</li>
						<li>CC is for FYI; I read CC less often than TO.</li>
						<li>Use @mentions to flag actions.</li>
						<li>Bottom Line Up Front works best:
							<ul>
								<li>Actions/dates first</li>
								<li>Then conclusion</li>
								<li>Then supporting facts</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					<h3>🧭 Logistics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>In the Bristol office:  Monday and Wednesday (7am to 4pm)</li>
	                    <li>Remote working or customer sites on other days:
	                        <ul>
	                        <li>Core hours roughly 10am to 4pm, with flexibility for life</li>

			<h3>🧠 How I Like to Work</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I aim for Level 1 of the Pyramid of Communication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>deep work first</li>
                        <li>then feedback loops</li>
                        <li>then messaging</li>
                        <li>then immediate feedback</li>
                        <li>then meetings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>I dislike context switching; mitigations: 
                <ul>
                    <li>15-minute buffers</li>
                    <li>task batching</li>
                    <li>time blocking</li>
					<li>Pomodoro.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
				<li>I need reflection time to frame rationale: I minimize notifications (email off, Teams set to DND during deep work).</li>
				<li>I don't like surprises: flag blockers, delays, or changes early so I can adjust.</li>
                <li>Meeting notes/actions should be captured collaboratively in real time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>1:1s</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>We keep a shared working doc (Teams Notes, Confluence, Wiki, SharePoint).</li>
				<li>Agenda is yours: concerns, development, issues; not for project status.</li>

			<h3>🧩 Decision Frameworks</h3>
			<p><em>I use this to spell out how I make calls: principles, thresholds, when I defer, and what "good" evidence looks like.</em></p>
			<h4>Information Gathering</h4>
			<p>Before I make a decision, I need four specific types of signal.  If I'm missing one, I'm gambling, not deciding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Root Cause" Signal:</strong> Is this a symptom or the disease? (eg, "Sales are down" is a symptom; "The checkout button is broken" is the disease).</li>
                <li><strong>The "Reversibility" Signal:</strong> How hard is it to undo this? (See the Type 1 vs. Type 2 framework below).
				 <ul>
				  <li>Type 1 Decision (One way door): Very difficult to reverse.  Action:  Slow down.  Seek 90% confidence and mupltiple expert opinions</li>
				  <li>Type 2 Decision (Two way door): Can be undone easily.  Action:  Move fast.  Seek 60%-70% confidence.  Progress is better than perfection.</li>
				 </ul>
				</li>
                <li><strong>The "Counter-Evidence" Signal:</strong> What is the strongest argument against this choice? If I can't find one, I have confirmation bias.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Opportunity Cost" Signal:</strong> If I spend £10,000 and 3 weeks on Option A, what am I explicitly choosing not to do?</li>
            </ul>
			<h4>The WRAP Process</h4>
			<p>I use this process so any short-term emotion doesn't affect the outcome.</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>W</strong>iden my options:  I never choose between "Yes or No".  I force myself to find at least three viable alternatives</li>
			  <li><strong>R</strong>eality test:  I find someone who diagrees with me.  Why?</li>
			  <li><strong>A</strong>ttain distance:  What would I tell a friend to do in this situation?  <em>Removes my immediate fear or ego</em></li>
			  <li><strong>P</strong>repare to be wrong:  Set a <strong>tripwire</strong>. <em>If x hasn't happened by y, we stop.</em></li>
			</ul>

						<p>Welcome to the Production Environment. Whilst every effort has been made to ship a stable version of myself, please be advised that this build contains several legacy features and unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
						<p>Below you'll find a comprehensive list of Known Defects. Quirky architectural choices and 'working-as-intended' bugs that haven't quite made it to the next sprint. I decided to treat these as documented features rather than system failures, so please review the changelog below before submitting a formal bug report.</p>
						<table>
							<thead>
								<tr><th>Defect</th><th>Workaround</th></tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr><td><strong>Migraine</strong><br />Stress, tiredness, poor eating/drinking can trigger; early signs: difficulty concentrating, possible emesis.</td><td>Sleep in a dark room; coffee, painkillers, sumatriptan.</td></tr>
								<tr><td><strong>Context assumption</strong><br />I may assume shared context and skip details.</td><td>Ask me to add context; I will happily expand.</td></tr>
								<tr><td><strong>Misophonia</strong><br/>Noises like loud eating/tea slurping can trigger.</td><td>If I eat too the effect lessens; I may step away briefly.</td></tr>
