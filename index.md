# 👋 Welcome
A single-page user manual so new teammates can work smoothly with me. Skim the highlights, then dive deeper where needed.

## ✅ Quick Facts
### Conversation starters
- Why I took up running
- The time I handcuffed myself to a shopping trolley
- The Back to the Future Trilogy
- Why I became qualified as a touch-typist at age 16 (RSA I/II/III, Pitman Advanced, C&G)
- One space or two after a full stop; discuss

### What I'm good at
- Order and structure; accuracy and quality
- Listening and understanding; fact-checking
- GIF games

### What I'm not good at
- Remembering to step out of the weeds
- Avoiding context switching
- Slowing down—my brain runs faster than I can speak
- Telling people I don't feel well
- Sending things before my wife proofreads them

### Favourite quotes
> It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end. — Ursula K. Le Guin

## 💬 Communication
- Preferred urgency ladder: Email → Teams → WhatsApp → Teams phone call.
- Email for detail and retrieval; real-time only when truly needed.
- If a thread needs >2–3 back-and-forths, suggest voice/video.
- Direct style; never intended to offend—explicit and unambiguous is the goal.
- Clear, bullet-heavy writing appreciated; over-communication beats ambiguity.
- Clear asks beat "Hello" pings; see https://nohello.net/en.
- I'm clearer in writing than in person; in person you may hear my thinking process aloud.

#### Email specifics
- I read everything; I reply only when needed.
- CC is for FYI; I read CC slower than TO.
- Use @mentions to flag actions.
- Bottom Line Up Front works best: actions/dates first, then conclusion, then supporting facts.

## 🧭 Logistics
- Core hours roughly 9–5, with flexibility for life; evenings/weekends are family time.
- I adapt for dispersed teams; time is taken back later.
- Personal boundaries matter; please share yours so we can respect them together.
- Calendar rules: always current; accept what I can attend, decline what I can't; avoid tentative. Prefer breaks between meetings and clear noun-based outcomes ("agreement on…"). Location is shown; feel free to book when free.
- Meeting notes/actions should be captured collaboratively in real time.

## 🧠 How I Like to Work
- Aim for Level 1 of the Pyramid of Communication: deep work first, then feedback loops, then messaging, then immediate feedback, then meetings.
- I dislike context switching; mitigations: 15-minute buffers, task batching, time blocking, Pomodoro.
- I need reflection time to frame rationale; I minimize notifications (email off, Teams set to DND during deep work).

### 1:1s
- We keep a shared working doc (Teams Notes, Confluence, Wiki, SharePoint).
- Agenda is yours: concerns, development, issues; not for project status.

## 🧩 Decision Frameworks
_Use this to spell out how I make calls: principles, thresholds, when I defer, and what "good" evidence looks like. Add examples of recent decisions and why they went that way._
- Consider noting: when to ship vs. perfect, risk tolerance, criteria for saying no, when to seek consensus vs. decide.
- Helpful reads: [The Decision Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393652370), [Mental Models by Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/mental-models/), [RACI basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix).

## 📅 Availability
_Describe patterns people can expect: focus blocks, meeting-free windows, response-time expectations, and how to reach you if something is truly urgent._
- Example: "Deep work 9–11 most days; replies slower then."  
- Example: "If red in calendar = truly heads-down; urgent = call."  
- Resource: [Cal Newport on time blocking](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/category/time-blocking/).

## ⚙️ Working Preferences
_Clarify environmental and collaboration preferences so teammates can set you up for success._
- Examples to capture: preferred document formats, async vs sync bias, feedback style (direct/softened), pairing cadence, meeting length defaults, camera/mic norms.
- Resource: [GitLab Handbook – Communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/).

## 🐛 Known Defects
| Defect | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| Migraine: Stress, tiredness, poor eating/drinking can trigger; early signs: difficulty concentrating, possible emesis. | Sleep in a dark room; coffee, painkillers, sumatriptan. |
| Context assumption: I may assume shared context and skip details. | Ask me to add context; I will happily expand. |
| Misophonia: Noises like loud eating/tea slurping can trigger. | If I eat too the effect lessens; I may step away briefly. |
