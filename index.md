		<section id="communication">
			<h2>💬 Communication</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Preferred urgency ladder: Email → Teams → WhatsApp → Teams phone call.</li>
				<li>Email for detail and retrieval; real-time only when truly needed.</li>
				<li>If a thread needs &gt;2 - 3 back-and-forths, suggest voice/video.</li>
				<li>Direct style; never intended to offend - explicit and unambiguous is the goal.</li>
				<li>Clear, bullet-heavy writing appreciated; over-communication beats ambiguity.</li>
				<li>Clear asks beat "Hello" pings; see <a href="https://nohello.net/en">https://nohello.net/en</a>.</li>
				<li>I'm clearer in writing than in person; in person you may hear my thinking process aloud.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Email specifics</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I read everything; I reply only when needed.</li>
				<li>CC is for FYI; I read CC less often than TO.</li>
				<li>Use @mentions to flag actions.</li>
				<li>Bottom Line Up Front works best:
					<ul>
						<li>Actions/dates first</li>
						<li>Then conclusion</li>
						<li>Then supporting facts</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="logistics">
			<h2>🧭 Logistics</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In the Bristol office:  Monday and Wednesday (7am to 4pm)</li>
                <li>Remote working on other days:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Core hours roughly 9am to 5pm, with flexibility for life</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Non-negotiable: evenings/weekends are family time.</li>
				<li>I adapt for dispersed teams; time is taken back later.</li>
				<li>Personal boundaries matter; please share yours so we can respect them together.</li>

		<section id="how-i-work">
			<h2>🧠 How I Like to Work</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Aim for Level 1 of the Pyramid of Communication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>deep work first</li>
                        <li>then feedback loops</li>
                        <li>then messaging</li>
                        <li>then immediate feedback</li>
                        <li>then meetings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>I dislike context switching; mitigations: 
                <ul>
                    <li>15-minute buffers</li>
                    <li>task batching</li>
                    <li>time blocking</li>
					<li>Pomodoro.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
				<li>I need reflection time to frame rationale: I minimize notifications (email off, Teams set to DND during deep work).</li>
                <li>Meeting notes/actions should be captured collaboratively in real time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>1:1s</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>We keep a shared working doc (Teams Notes, Confluence, Wiki, SharePoint).</li>
				<li>Agenda is yours: concerns, development, issues; not for project status.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="decision-frameworks">
			<h2>🧩 Decision Frameworks</h2>
			<p><em>I use this to spell out how I make calls: principles, thresholds, when I defer, and what "good" evidence looks like. TODO // Add examples of recent decisions and why they went that way.</em></p>
			<p>Before I make a decision, I need four specific types of signal.  If I'm missing one, I'm gambling, not deciding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "Root Cause" Signal: Is this a symptom or the disease? (eg, "Sales are down" is a symptom; "The checkout button is broken" is the disease).</li>
                <li>The "Reversibility" Signal: How hard is it to undo this? (See the Type 1 vs. Type 2 framework below).</li>
                <li>The "Counter-Evidence" Signal: What is the strongest argument against this choice? If I can't find one, I have confirmation bias.</li>
                <li>The "Opportunity Cost" Signal: If I spend £10,000 and 3 weeks on Option A, what am I explicitly choosing not to do?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>TODO My criteria for saying no</p>
            <p>TODO My risk tolerance</p>
            <p>TODO My core frameworks</p>
			<ul>
                <li>Helpful reads: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393652370">The Decision Book</a>, <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Mental Models by Farnam Street</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix">RACI basics</a>.</li>

		<section id="availability">
			<h2>📅 Availability</h2>
			<p><em>Here I describe patterns people can expect: focus blocks, meeting-free windows, response-time expectations, and how to reach you if something is truly urgent.</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep work every Friday.  Will decline most meetings.</li>
                <li>If 'red' in calendar = truly heads down; urgent = call</li>
                <li>I time block; see <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day">See Cal Newport on Time Blocking</a>.</li>
                <li>Calendar rules: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>always current; I accept what I can attend.</li>
                        <li>decline what I can't; avoid tentative.</li>
                        <li>Prefer breaks between meetings</li>
                        <li>Location is shown; feel free to book when free.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
			</ul>

		<section id="working-preferences">
			<h2>⚙️ Working Preferences</h2>
			<p><em>Here I clarify environmental and collaboration preferences so teammates are set up for success.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Examples to capture: preferred document formats, async vs sync bias, feedback style (direct/softened), pairing cadence, meeting length defaults, camera/mic norms.</li>

			<h2>🐛 Known Defects</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Production Environment. Whilst every effort has been made to ship a stable version of myself, please be advised that this build contains several legacy features and unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p>Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of Known Defects. Quirky architectural choices and 'working-as-intended' bugs that haven't quite made it to the next sprint. I decided to treat these as documented features rather than system failures, so please review the changelog below before submitting a formal bug report.
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><th>Defect</th><th>Workaround</th></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td><strong>Migraine</strong><br />Stress, tiredness, poor eating/drinking can trigger; early signs: difficulty concentrating, possible emesis.</td><td>Sleep in a dark room; coffee, painkillers, sumatriptan.</td></tr>
					<tr><td><strong>Context assumption</strong><br />I may assume shared context and skip details.</td><td>Ask me to add context; I will happily expand.</td></tr>
					<tr><td><strong>Misophonia</strong><br/>Noises like loud eating/tea slurping can trigger.</td><td>If I eat too the effect lessens; I may step away briefly.</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

		<section id="todo">
			<h2>📌 TODO</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I don't like surprises</li>
				<li>Names are our identity</li>
				<li>My humour (or lack of, according to my 9-year-old)</li>
			</ul>
