		<section id="communication">
			<h2>💬 Communication</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Preferred urgency ladder: Email → Teams → WhatsApp → Teams phone call.</li>
				<li>Email for detail and retrieval; real-time only when truly needed.</li>
				<li>If a thread needs &gt;2 - 3 back-and-forths, suggest voice/video.</li>
				<li>Direct style; never intended to offend - explicit and unambiguous is the goal.</li>
				<li>Clear, bullet-heavy writing appreciated; over-communication beats ambiguity.</li>
				<li>Clear asks beat "Hello" pings; see <a href="https://nohello.net/en">https://nohello.net/en</a>.</li>
				<li>I'm clearer in writing than in person; in person you may hear my thinking process aloud.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Email specifics</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I read everything; I reply only when needed.</li>
				<li>CC is for FYI; I read CC less often than TO.</li>
				<li>Use @mentions to flag actions.</li>
				<li>Bottom Line Up Front works best:
					<ul>
						<li>Actions/dates first</li>
						<li>Then conclusion</li>
						<li>Then supporting facts</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="logistics">
			<h2>🧭 Logistics</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In the office:  Monday and Wednesday (7am to 4pm)</li>
                <li>Remote working on other days:  Core hours roughly 9–5, with flexibility for life; evenings/weekends are family time.</li>
				<li>I adapt for dispersed teams; time is taken back later.</li>
				<li>Personal boundaries matter; please share yours so we can respect them together.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="how-i-work">
			<h2>🧠 How I Like to Work</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Aim for Level 1 of the Pyramid of Communication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>deep work first</li>
                        <li>then feedback loops</li>
                        <li>then messaging</li>
                        <li>then immediate feedback</li>
                        <li>then meetings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>I dislike context switching; mitigations: 15-minute buffers, task batching, time blocking, Pomodoro.</li>
				<li>I need reflection time to frame rationale; I minimize notifications (email off, Teams set to DND during deep work).</li>
                <li>Meeting notes/actions should be captured collaboratively in real time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>1:1s</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>We keep a shared working doc (Teams Notes, Confluence, Wiki, SharePoint).</li>
				<li>Agenda is yours: concerns, development, issues; not for project status.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="decision-frameworks">
			<h2>🧩 Decision Frameworks</h2>
			<p><em>Use this to spell out how I make calls: principles, thresholds, when I defer, and what "good" evidence looks like. Add examples of recent decisions and why they went that way.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consider noting: when to ship vs. perfect, risk tolerance, criteria for saying no, when to seek consensus vs. decide.</li>
				<li>Helpful reads: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393652370">The Decision Book</a>, <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Mental Models by Farnam Street</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix">RACI basics</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="availability">
			<h2>📅 Availability</h2>
			<p><em>Describe patterns people can expect: focus blocks, meeting-free windows, response-time expectations, and how to reach you if something is truly urgent.</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep work every Friday.  Will decline most meetings</li>
                <li>If 'red' in calendar = truly heads down; urgent = call</li>
                <li>I time block; see <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day">See Cal Newport on Time Blocking</a>.</li>
                <li>Calendar rules: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>always current; I accept what I can attend</li>
                        <li>decline what I can't; avoid tentative.</li>
                        <li>Prefer breaks between meetings and clear noun-based outcomes ("agreement on...")</li>
                        <li>Location is shown; feel free to book when free.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

			</ul>

		<section id="working-preferences">
			<h2>⚙️ Working Preferences</h2>
			<p><em>Clarify environmental and collaboration preferences so teammates can set you up for success.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Examples to capture: preferred document formats, async vs sync bias, feedback style (direct/softened), pairing cadence, meeting length defaults, camera/mic norms.</li>
				<li>Resource: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/">GitLab Handbook – Communication</a>.</li>

		<section id="known-defects">
			<h2>🐛 Known Defects</h2>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><th>Defect</th><th>Workaround</th></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>Migraine: Stress, tiredness, poor eating/drinking can trigger; early signs: difficulty concentrating, possible emesis.</td><td>Sleep in a dark room; coffee, painkillers, sumatriptan.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Context assumption: I may assume shared context and skip details.</td><td>Ask me to add context; I will happily expand.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Misophonia: Noises like loud eating/tea slurping can trigger.</td><td>If I eat too the effect lessens; I may step away briefly.</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

		<section id="todo">
			<h2>📌 TODO</h2>
			<ul>
